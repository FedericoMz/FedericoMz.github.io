  Hi! I'm currently a PhD Fellow in AI at the University of Pisa, with a background in Data Science. On this page, you'll find a compilation of the projects I've undertaken over the years, whereas <a href="https://flowcv.com/resume/mvwcmvh8l1">here</a> you can find my up-to-date CV. If you want to get in contact, feel free to <a href="mailto:mazzoni.federico1@gmail.com">drop an email</a> or add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-mazzoni-728953247/">LinkedIn</a>. I love going out of my comfort zone to learn something new.
