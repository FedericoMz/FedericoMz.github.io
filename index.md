## My Portfolio

### Academic Projects
These are the projects I worked on during my PhD.

- The **[_Trust Analyzer_](https://gricetrust.streamlit.app/)** is a WIP project. It aims to analyze conversational trust either in a network of humans, or between a human user and an LLM.
- **[_Frank_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/Frank/)** is a Hybrid Decision-Making system, learning little by little from the user to help them make good, unbiased, and consistent decisions. It employs Incremental Learning in a novel way.
- **[_GenFair_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/GenFair)** is a data augmentation framework, that employs a genetic algorithm to create synthetic data to make a dataset fair. 
- **[_FairNet_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FedericoMz/FedericoMz.github.io/main/FairNet_Poster.pdf)** is GenFair's counterpart for networks. We assumed that in a "fair" network, no group should be marginalized, and we created a recommender system to achieve that condition.

Out of GenFair, a Master's student from my University developed her own algorithm, _[SafeGen](https://github.com/rossiele/SafeGen)_, which I supervised, and I experimented with _[GenBalance](https://github.com/FedericoMz/GenBalance)_. Respectively, they focused on fairness + privacy, and fairness + imbalanced learning. I also developed two simple tools that found their way into _Frank_, [_Simple Counterfactual_](SimpleCounterfactual) and [_FairCheck_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/FairCheck).

### Personal Projects
These are my more personal projects. :)

- Remember those old black and white Game Boy games? **[_Simple Palette Maker_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/SimplePaletteMaker)** allows the user to colorize them when played on the Analogue Pocket.

### Test Projects
Here are the projects I developed either as a test, or when I was an University student. The code might be a little dirty!

- **[_Django_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/DjangoTest)**. Managing restaurants, recipes, and ingredients.
- **[_Text Analytics_](https://github.com/ericacau/Text-Analytics)**. Classifying the genre of several books from GoodReads.
- **[_Laboratory of Data Science_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/LDS)**. Employing an ETL framework (including MDX, Visual Studio) for BI.
- **[_Distributed Data Mining_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/DDAM-APPEAL)**. Distributed analysis of a large dataset of Android apps.
- **[_Social Network Analysis_](https://github.com/andreafailla/Who-Made-the-Switch)**. Temporal analysis of Nintendo communities from Twitter.
- **[_Statistics_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/StagedPolitics)**. Textual and statistical analysis of tweets from Italian politicians.
- **[_Advanced Data Mining_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/StagedPolitics)**. Analysis and classification of songs with advanced Data Mining techniques.
