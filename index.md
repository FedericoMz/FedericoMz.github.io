## My Portfolio

### Academic Projects
These are the projects I worked on during my PhD.

- **[_TETRA_](https://github.com/simonamazzarino/TETRA)** (TExtual TRust Analyzer) allows analyzing conversational trust following three linguistic maxims. It has been tested in a network of humans.
- **[_Frank_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58553-1_19)** is a Hybrid Decision-Making system, learning little by little from the user to help them make good, unbiased, and consistent decisions. It employs Incremental Learning in a novel way. Developed as part of the EU [TANGO Project](https://tango-horizon.eu/).
- **[_Bridget_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19415)** aims to "bridge the gap" between Hybrid Decision-Making systems where the users are in command (such as Frank) and those where the machine is in command (such as Learning-to-Defer). It dynamically switches between the two states.
- **[_GenFair_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58553-1_19)** is a data augmentation framework. It employs a genetic algorithm to create synthetic data to make a dataset fair. Developed as my Master's thesis. A Master's student from my University later developed her own algorithm based on GenFair, _[SafeGen](https://github.com/rossiele/SafeGen)_, which I supervised. It is focused on privacy & fairness.
- **[_FairNet_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/FedericoMzOld.github.io/raw/main/FairNet_Poster.pdf)** is GenFair's counterpart for networks. We assumed that in a "fair" network, no group should be marginalized, and we created a recommender system to achieve that condition.

### Personal Projects
These are my more personal projects. :)

- Remember those old black and white Game Boy games? **[_Simple Palette Maker_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/SimplePaletteMaker)** allows the user to colorize them when played on the Analogue Pocket.

### Test Projects
Here are the projects I developed either as a test, or when I was an University student. The code might be a little dirty!

- **[_Django_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/DjangoTest)**. Managing restaurants, recipes, and ingredients.
- **[_Text Analytics_](https://github.com/ericacau/Text-Analytics)**. Classifying the genre of several books from GoodReads.
- **[_Laboratory of Data Science_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/LDS)**. Employing an ETL framework (including MDX, Visual Studio) for BI.
- **[_Distributed Data Mining_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/DDAM-APPEAL)**. Distributed analysis of a large dataset of Android apps.
- **[_Social Network Analysis_](https://github.com/andreafailla/Who-Made-the-Switch)**. Temporal analysis of Nintendo communities from Twitter.
- **[_Statistics_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/StagedPolitics)**. Textual and statistical analysis of tweets from Italian politicians.
- **[_Advanced Data Mining_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/DM2-FMAProject)**. Analysis and classification of songs with advanced Data Mining techniques.
