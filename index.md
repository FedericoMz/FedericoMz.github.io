## My Portfolio

### Personal Projects
These are my more personal projects. :)

- **[_HINTT_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/HINTT)** Is Not a Traditional Translator, but an interactive localisation tool for real-time text translation leveraging OpenAI visual capabilities.
- Remember those old black and white Game Boy games? **[_Simple Palette Maker_](https://github.com/FedericoMz/SimplePaletteMaker)** allows the user to colorize them when played on the Analogue Pocket.

### Academic Projects
These are the projects I worked on during my PhD. The code might be a little messy and not up to my current standard.

- **[_TETRA_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78980-9_23)** (TExtual TRust Analyzer) is a Python library to analyse conversational trust following three linguistic maxims. We made use of Sentence Transformers, Information Density detection, and existing libraries. [Code](https://github.com/simonamazzarino/TETRA/).
- **[_Frank_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58553-1_19)** is a Hybrid Decision-Making system, learning little by little from the user to help them make good, unbiased, and consistent decisions. It employs Incremental Learning in a novel way. Developed as part of the EU [TANGO Project](https://tango-horizon.eu/). [Code](https://github.com/FedericoMz/Frank/).
- **[_Bridget_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19415)** aims to "bridge the gap" between Hybrid Decision-Making systems where the users are in command (such as Frank) and those where the machine is in command (such as Learning-to-Defer). It dynamically switches between the two states.
- **[_GenFair_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58553-1_19)** is a data augmentation framework. It employs a genetic algorithm to create synthetic data to make a dataset fair. Developed as my Master's thesis. [Code](https://github.com/FedericoMz/GenFair).
- **[_FairNet_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78541-2_9)** is GenFair's counterpart for networks. We assumed that in a "fair" network, no group should be marginalized, and we created a recommender system to achieve that condition. [Code](https://github.com/FedericoMz/FairNet).
